  Build production-quality three.js WebGL scenes with vanilla three.js (no R3F).
  Use this skill whenever the user mentions three.js, WebGL, 3D scenes in the browser,
  isometric games, voxel worlds, infinite/endless scrollable 3D, procedural geometry,
  instancing/BatchedMesh, billboards, particle systems, shader effects, glitch effects,
  bloom, lens flares, god rays, depth of field, chromatic aberration, stereoscopy,
  anaglyph, film grain, HUD transitions, camera controls (orbit/follow/pan-zoom),
  touch-friendly 3D controls, three.js performance optimization, draw-call reduction,
  LOD, post-processing chains, EffectComposer, GLSL ShaderMaterial, or LLM-driven
  programmatic generation of three.js content. Also trigger when the user wants to
  build a 3D web experience, mounts a `canvas` for three.js, asks "how do I make
  this run smooth", needs frame-rate capping, or wants to generate 3D assets from
  text prompts via Gemini / ai-sdk function tools.

# three.js Scenes ⚘ Production Skill

Vanilla three.js (WebGL2) skill covering scene composition, programmatic generation,
camera handling, post-processing, voxel worlds, infinite scenes, and LLM-driven
codegen. No WebGPU, no R3F, no Drei — just `three` from the main entry point.

## Querying the three.js docs

Never answer upstream three.js API questions from memory. three.js publishes
LLM-friendly docs — `https://threejs.org/docs/llms.txt` (guidelines + curated
index), `https://threejs.org/docs/llms-full.txt` (full TSL reference + page
catalog), and per-class markdown at `https://threejs.org/docs/pages/<Name>.html.md`.
Use the bundled CLI to fetch exactly what the task needs:

```sh
node scripts/query-threejs-docs.js page InstancedMesh      # one class as markdown
node scripts/query-threejs-docs.js section render pipeline # one llms-full.txt section
node scripts/query-threejs-docs.js search compute shader   # find pages + sections
```

See `references/threejs-docs-lookup.md` for the full command set and a
topic → relevant-pages map for every reference file in this skill.

## Scripts Index

The `scripts/` directory contains production-ready ES-module JavaScript implementations
of every reference example. See `scripts/INDEX.md` for the full table mapping each
script to its reference section and a one-line summary.

When asked to build something covered by a script, read the script directly rather
than re-deriving the code. Adapt the function signatures and options to the user's
specific request — the scripts are templates, not black boxes.

The 1.1 scripts (`extruded-mesh.js`, `geometry-modifiers.js`, `material-presets.js`,
`prop-factory.js`, `prop-composite.js`, `animation-controller.js`, `gltf-prop.js`,
`jsx-scene.js`) import the **library** (`@tuomashatakka/threejs-scenes`)
rather than inlining helpers — see **Using the Library** below.

## Runnable Templates

The `templates/` directory holds complete, **self-contained HTML scenes that run
by just opening the file in a browser** — no build step, no dev server, no install.
Each loads `three` from the `esm.sh` CDN via an importmap (so it needs internet),
and inlines its own helpers (frame loop, pointer gesture, disposal) so there are
no local module imports to break under `file://`.

Use a template as the fastest path to a working scene: copy it, then replace the
clearly-marked content section (e.g. `buildContent()` in `minimal-scene.html`).
For multi-module projects, graduate to the `scripts/` modules + an importmap.

| Template | Demonstrates |
|----------|--------------|
| `templates/bootstrap.html` | Library starter — `createApp`: unidirectional store→module→scene flow, fixed-step deterministic clock, seeded particles. Copy this first for library-backed apps. |
| `templates/minimal-scene.html` | Starter scaffold — renderer + orbit camera + lit flat-shaded mesh + `ResizeObserver` + dispose + `__SCENE_READY__`. Copy and replace `buildContent()`. |
| `templates/instanced-field.html` | `InstancedMesh` — ~5000 objects, 1 draw call, seeded `mulberry32` placement, draw-call HUD. |
| `templates/shader-material.html` | Custom GLSL `ShaderMaterial` — fresnel rim + scanlines + noise; uniforms mutated allocation-free. |
| `templates/post-processing.html` | `EffectComposer`: `RenderPass → UnrealBloom → grade(ShaderPass) → OutputPass`; grade in linear HDR, tone-map once. |
| `templates/isometric.html` | Orthographic true-iso camera + instanced height-grid terrain (value-noise) + pan/zoom. |
| `templates/particles.html` | Particles v2 — `createEmitter` shapes/curves/bursts + 65k GPGPU field toggle (`createGpuEmitter`); cadence-independent determinism. |
| `templates/geometry.html` | Library demo — extrusion + vertex modifiers + grid layout via the lib (`@scenes`). |
| `templates/materials.html` | Library demo — PBR / toon / matcap presets. |
| `templates/props.html` | Library demo — `defineProp` crystal (mesh + light + clips) + instanced forest + composite. |
| `templates/animation.html` | Library demo — `createAnimationController` + programmatic clips; tap to crossfade. |
| `templates/jsx-scene.html` | Library demo — reactive JSX/hyperscript layer; a signal drives a per-frame rotation. |

The first six templates are self-contained (inlined helpers, esm.sh `three`). The
five **library-backed** templates (`geometry`, `materials`, `props`, `animation`,
`jsx-scene`) instead import the published package via importmap (`@scenes` →
esm.sh `@tuomashatakka/threejs-scenes`, pinned to this skill's version; `three`
from esm.sh) — see `references/library.md`. The skill does not bundle a copy of
the library.

These templates encode the patterns in `references/production-lessons.md` — read
that doc when adapting them into anything multi-module.

## Using the Library

For multi-module scenes prefer importing the library over copy-pasting scripts.
Artifacts import the published npm package from esm.sh, version-pinned to this
skill. The `?external=three,…` query keeps the library's `three` imports bare so
the page importmap resolves them — exactly one three.js instance. Import it
through an importmap so artifacts stay self-contained:

```html
<script type="importmap">
{
  "imports": {
    "three":         "https://esm.sh/three@0.184.0",
    "three/addons/": "https://esm.sh/three@0.184.0/examples/jsm/",
    "@tuomashatakka/canvas-loop-framecapper": "https://esm.sh/@tuomashatakka/canvas-loop-framecapper@1.0.0",
    "@scenes":       "https://esm.sh/@tuomashatakka/threejs-scenes@1.7.3?external=three,@tuomashatakka/canvas-loop-framecapper",
    "@scenes/jsx":   "https://esm.sh/@tuomashatakka/threejs-scenes@1.7.3/jsx?external=three,@tuomashatakka/canvas-loop-framecapper"
  }
}
</script>
<script type="module">
  import { bootstrapScene, createExtrudedMesh, createStandardMaterial } from '@scenes'
  import { render, h, signal } from '@scenes/jsx'
</script>
```

The library is structured into three main, tree-shakeable public entry points:
- `@tuomashatakka/threejs-scenes` (WebGL core, scaffolding, cameras, animations, lighting, materials, geometry, instancing, loaders, and state management)
- `@tuomashatakka/threejs-scenes/webgpu` (Dedicated WebGPU post-processing and TSL effects)
- `@tuomashatakka/threejs-scenes/jsx` (Declarative, reactive JSX layer)

See `references/library.md` for integration details.

### JSX layer (declarative, reactive)

`@scenes/jsx` is a higher-level layer over the factories — author a scene as
elements and `render(tree, { canvas })` mounts it, driving reactivity from the
**main frame loop**: a function-valued prop is an accessor re-read every frame,
plain values apply once. Use hyperscript `h(...)` for a no-build artifact, or JSX
with `jsxImportSource: "@tuomashatakka/threejs-scenes/jsx"`. Intrinsics: `<scene>`,
`<camera type=perspective|iso|follow>`, `<light type=spot|point|directional|ambient|
hemisphere>`, `<group>`, `<mesh>`, `<primitive>`, `<prop src=…>` (factory / `.ts`
module / model file), `<instances>`, `<post>`. See `references/jsx-layer.md`.

## Embedding Scripts in Live Artifacts

Three.js scenes ship to the user as Claude **artifacts** of type `text/html`. The
artifact runs in a sandboxed iframe with no access to a build tool, so every script
in `scripts/` is authored as a self-contained ES module that can be:

1. **Pasted as a function body** into a `<script type="module">` block — simplest
   for one-off demos.
2. **Imported via `esm.sh`** with importmaps — clean for multi-module artifacts.

### Pattern 1 — Inline (smallest artifacts, single-file demos)

Read the relevant script file with `view`, then copy the exported functions into the
`<script type="module">` block of the artifact. Replace the `import * as THREE from
'three'` line with a CDN import from `esm.sh`. Inline `frame-loop.js` first (it's the
backbone), then add the modules the scene needs.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover" />
  <title>three.js scene</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="tokens.css" />
  <style>
    html, body { margin: 0; height: 100%; background: var(--color-neutral-950); overflow: hidden }
    canvas { display: block; width: 100%; height: 100%; touch-action: none }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <main>
    <canvas id="scene"></canvas>
  </main>

  <script type="module">
    import * as THREE from 'https://esm.sh/three@0.184.0'
    import { EffectComposer } from 'https://esm.sh/three@0.184.0/addons/postprocessing/EffectComposer.js'
    import { RenderPass }     from 'https://esm.sh/three@0.184.0/addons/postprocessing/RenderPass.js'
    import { OutputPass }     from 'https://esm.sh/three@0.184.0/addons/postprocessing/OutputPass.js'

    // ----- PASTED FROM scripts/frame-loop.js -----
    // (copy the full module contents here, omitting the import line)

    // ----- PASTED FROM scripts/renderer-setup.js -----

    // ----- PASTED FROM scripts/pointer-gesture.js -----

    // ----- scene wiring -----
    const canvas = document.querySelector('#scene')
    const renderer = createRenderer({ canvas })
    const scene = new THREE.Scene()
    const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(50, canvas.clientWidth / canvas.clientHeight, 0.1, 200)
    camera.position.set(4, 3, 6)
    camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0)

    startRenderLoop({ renderer, scene, camera })
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Pattern 2 — Importmap (multi-module artifacts, cleaner separation)

For larger scenes, use an importmap so the `import` paths inside each pasted script
need no rewriting. Three.js addons resolve through the same map.

```html
<script type="importmap">
{
  "imports": {
    "three":               "https://esm.sh/three@0.184.0",
    "three/addons/":       "https://esm.sh/three@0.184.0/addons/"
  }
}
</script>
<script type="module">
  import * as THREE from 'three'
  import { EffectComposer } from 'three/addons/postprocessing/EffectComposer.js'
  // … scripts paste in unchanged
</script>
```

### Pattern 3 — `<script type="module">` from `data:` URLs (rare, only when isolation matters)

Only use when an artifact mixes multiple isolated demos in one HTML page. Convert
each script to a `data:text/javascript;base64,` URL and import it. Most artifacts
should NOT need this.

### Embedding Checklist

Before shipping any artifact:

- [ ] Canvas element exists and has `touch-action: none` in CSS.
- [ ] Renderer uses `setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2))`.
- [ ] A `ResizeObserver` is attached to the canvas's parent (NOT `window.resize`).
- [ ] Every pointer interaction uses `pointerdown`/`pointermove`/`pointerup`/`pointercancel` — never `mouse*` or `touch*`.
- [ ] The frame loop is the singleton `frameLoopManager` from `scripts/frame-loop.js`.
- [ ] Cleanup function disposes geometries, materials, textures, render targets.
- [ ] No `new Vector3()` / `new Matrix4()` / `new Color()` inside the render loop.
- [ ] Materials are shared across meshes wherever possible.
- [ ] Programmatic data (instance transforms, geometry vertices, particle attributes) is generated from a seeded factory, not hand-typed past ~20 entries.
- [ ] On mobile (`navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0`), expensive post-fx (god rays, DOF) are disabled by default.

## Prompt Handling Flow

Every user request goes through classification + scoped action. See
`references/prompt-handling-flow.md` for the full taxonomy.

Quick decision tree:

1. **Is this a one-off question or a scene to build?** Question → answer inline.
   Scene → continue.
2. **Read `core-principles.md`** if not already loaded this session.
3. **Classify the request** (geometry / shader / camera / effect-pass / instancing /
   particle / lighting / scene-composition / optimization / debug).
4. **Load the matching reference file(s)** from the table above.
5. **Reuse scripts** — check `scripts/INDEX.md` before writing anything from scratch.
6. **Generate via LLM tools** if the task is procedural and config-driven (palette,
   placement, voxel level layout, shader recipe). See
   `references/llm-function-definitions.md`.
7. **Emit code** as a complete, working module with a `// perf:` annotation.
8. **Wire into artifact** following the embedding patterns above.

## Style Guarantees

Every artifact and code module produced under this skill must:

- Follow `@tuomashatakka/eslint-config` (no semis, single quotes, two-space indent, no `any`).
- Apply Semantic Nodes style to all non-3D UI (HTML5 landmarks, design-token CSS,
  tag selectors over class selectors, no Tailwind / Shadcn / Radix / CSS Modules).
- Use `pointer*` events exclusively — never `mouse*` or `touch*`.
- Disable native gestures over the canvas with `touch-action: none`.
- Cap pixel ratio at 2.
- Annotate non-trivial outputs with expected draw-call class and memory footprint.

## When Things Go Wrong

- **Black canvas** → camera position likely inside geometry, or scene has no lights AND material isn't `MeshBasicMaterial`. Add a `HemisphereLight` for fast diagnosis.
- **Shader compile error** → wrap GLSL in `/* glsl */` template literals; check uniform names match exactly between JS and shader.
- **Frame stalls on first render** → call `renderer.compile(scene, camera)` before first `render()`.
- **GC spikes mid-scene** → audit the render loop for `new Vector3()`, closures capturing fresh objects, or `Array.from()` calls.
- **Touch drag breaks when finger leaves canvas** → missing `el.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId)` in `pointerdown`.
- **Sharp aliasing on mobile** → `antialias: true` is often ignored on iOS; use FXAA pass instead.
- **Z-fighting on co-planar surfaces** → tighten the camera frustum (`near` / `far`) or use logarithmic depth buffer.
